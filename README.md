# True-Crime-NYC-Resurrection
True Crime: NYC Resurrection is an open source project on resurrecting the iconic game of 2005 True Crime: New York City!

The aim of this project is to perfect the game with improvements so it will perform efficently on modern machines & to create mods from our [community](https://codings.zulipchat.com) to make the ultimate fun time on the game. We want players to experience the amazing storyline which takes place in Manhattan. After that we want to be able to have fun in all the modding ways many other games have done & formed communities around.

To do that we need the most dedicated fans of the True Crime series to band together to make this possible. Together we can develop improvements such as widescreen resolution, 60fps, fix any flickering graphics, control adjustments, & more. For fun with modding we can develop a spawn menu, reactivate the debug menu disabled in the PC version, create extra functionality, model swap, & much more!

Be apart of the development by [joining our community](https://codings.zulipchat.com) we appreciate everyone who's willing to contribute. There you will be able to find our latest discussions & updates on what's happening currently!
